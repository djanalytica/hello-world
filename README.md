# hello-world
an introduction to the committed

Greetings from quarantine.  Our mayor has imposed a soviet style reward system to report people who go outside so we're living in a paranoid state of cabin fever stacked on top of each other in tiny apartments but I still have a laptop and an internet connection so I figure the best use of my time is data science.  Cheers!
